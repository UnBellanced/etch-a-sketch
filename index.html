        <!--Inside this container we'll be creating the grid out of div squares with js
        This container should have a specific length of 960px, forcing the children to flex into the appropriate size
        The way the grid would be created is by taking the given number (deafult 16) and creating as many sub-flexboxes
        and giving each of the sub flex-boxes that same number of children.
        The flexboxes should flex for the width and the children should flex for the height
        This means the main flex box would be column directed while the children would be row directed
    
        The div children themselves should all flex the same way, and they should fill up the entire space
        They should all shrink the same way too, and they should have the same "minimum" shrinkage 
        The div boxes should all have the same class name when created so we can attribute to all of them
        listeners using js which would manipulate the css upon moving through a grid.
    
        The css would be manipulated in such a way so that the rgb color for the grid is randomly set
        on the first pass, but the random numbers for the color should give a light color
        and then each other pass would .darker() the rgb color by 10%. This would be done by checking if
        there is already a color there or not to keep the color and only darken it.
    
        Be careful with borders and margins.
    
        Add a button that would allow the user to specify the value for the number of squares per side
        of the grid. This would remove the grid that's currently there by un-appending the sub-flex boxes
        and then creating the new grid using the same function that created the previous grid except with the
        given dimensions instead of the deafult 16 and a max of 100 for the input.
        The button would call on a prompt tag which would in turn take the input and give it to us.
    
        you might need to use 'this' keyword to manipulate the elemenet that the function is 'working on currently'
    
        Make sure to write clean code by making dividing everything into functions.-->
